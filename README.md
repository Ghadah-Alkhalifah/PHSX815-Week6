# PHSX815-Week6
# Hw6:
file `Num_int.py` calculate the integral of a function using trapazoidal rule and Guassian quadrature with errors. It also computes the analytical value of the integral.
### How to use code:
1. use folder `Hw6`.
2. Run file `Num_int.py -h` in terminal. you can change the limits of integral `-a -b` and the number of points `-n`.

# Hw7:
file `MC_I.py' calculate the integral for the same function from Hw6 and add Monte carlo integration method in one dimension. It seems the monte carlo not efficient with low 'n' points as the Guassian quadrature.
## How to run the code:
1. use folder `Hw7`.
2. Run file `MC_I.py -h` in terminal. you can change the limits of integral `-a -b` and the number of points `-n` and the seed number `-seed` from terminal.
3. Run `MC_2D.py` to calculate integral in 2D for different 'n' sample points. No choice to change the integral limits and seed in terminal.
